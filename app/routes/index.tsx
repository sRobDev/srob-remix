        Welcome!

      <p>
        I'm Samuel, and by day I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://system1.com/">System1</a> working on Mapquest.com (yes, we're still around). In my free time, I work on and write for <a href="https://better.dev">Better Dev</a> alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/chris__sev">Chris Sev</a>.</p>
      <p>
        In my role at MapQuest, I work as a tech lead in our effort to rebuild the site in <mark>React</mark> - actually, Preact - backed by <mark>Node</mark> microservices, with state management handled by <mark>Redux</mark> and a fairly robust <mark>Cypress</mark> testing infrastructure.

        Outside of web development, I have pretty simple joys in life - my wonderful wife, family, video games, and essentially anything in the outdoors.

        The posts on this site will be all over the place, and not necessarily all related to web development. I take a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx">swyx</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist">Linus Lee</a>, especially in regards to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> and both their general approaches to constant writing, creativity, and self improvement.
